# Heart_Failure-Model
The Heart Disease Prediction project is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using clinical and demographic data. By analyzing 11 key features, this model helps in early detection and risk assessment, which is crucial for timely intervention and prevention of cardiovascular events.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset contains 1,190 unique patient records, curated by combining five different heart disease datasets (Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach VA, and Stalog). It includes 11 common features:
Age: Age of the patient (years)
Sex: Gender of the patient (M/F)
ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (TA, ATA, NAP, ASY)
RestingBP: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
FastingBS: Fasting blood sugar (1 if >120 mg/dl, 0 otherwise)
RestingECG: Resting electrocardiogram results (Normal, ST, LVH)
MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise
ExerciseAngina: Exercise-induced angina (Y/N)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
ST_Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up, Flat, Down)

The target variable is:
HeartDisease: 1 if the patient has heart disease, 0 if normal

#  Purpose & Applications:

Early Detection: Identify individuals at high risk of heart disease for timely intervention.
Healthcare Analysis: Support research in cardiovascular risk factors and clinical outcomes.
Machine Learning Education: Provide a practical example for classification modeling and feature engineering.
Decision Support: Aid doctors and healthcare professionals in risk assessment and management.

# Potential Insights:
This dataset allows analysis of how factors like age, cholesterol, exercise-induced angina, and blood pressure influence the likelihood of heart disease. It can also help in identifying high-risk groups and developing preventive strategies.
